			<h1>New update</h1>
			<p>Warzone Season 3 has been confirmed to start on April 22. The makers will release the update on April 21 at 9 p.m. PT and on April 22 at 12 a.m. ET.  This will allow the users to load the update before it has been launched. Some players have even found out about the changes made to the nuke event because of the new season launch. This will also bring in some changes to the popular map called Verdansk along with Season 3. Apart from this, there are also a number of different changes that have been made to the game. We have managed to list all these changes including the Sykov nerf and more by uploading the recent patch notes released on Raven Software’s official website. </p>
